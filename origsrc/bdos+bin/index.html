<title> BDOS+ - convert files from PC-Disks to CBM-Disks and vice versa</title>

<p> A previous version of this programm has been published by the
german magazin "64er", which is still alive and reachable by email.
</p>
<p> A basic introduction is in the archive, but especially the menu version
should be quite self-explanatory. The original programm is in german, and
this version is still included. The translated version may suffer from
this translation, sorry about that.</p>
<p> I have some documentation to download (<a href="http:bdos+doc.cpk.gz">
"bdos+doc.cpk.gz"</a>, but unfortunately it is in german. 
I will only translate it if some of you want me to, but you only need
it to really dig into the system (hey man, it works, you don't need to 
dig...).</p>
<p> The programm runs on a C128 with VC1571 or a C64 with VC1571. It does not
run on a C128 in C64 mode!  The only
problem with the C64 is the hardware modification you have to apply to your
C64 to use the burst commands of the 1571. I haven't found out a way how to 
do it without, but maybe someone else knows this? The Modification is
described in the 64er magazin 6/89, but attention! The one printed has a
small error. The on/off switch puts +5V to the PA2 pin instead of the
NOR-input! (It was my fault, but unfortunately passed all checks... The
correct diagram must be in one of the following issues. The on/off
switch should switch the NOR-input between +5V (off) and CA2 (on).) </p>
<p> If you want to use other hardware, see what is being done in CD* or
VD*, these are the disk drivers for C64 and C128 respectively. The drivers
in CB* or VB* make the RAM-Disk and the window interface routines, esp.
for the C64.</p>

<p>
"*.cpk"</a> is a kind of archive built with my own 
C64 tool. This was to
keep the long filenames when I backed up on my old Atari. You can either
use the tool "uncpk" or the original C64 programm to unpack. (see directory
<a href="http:../packing/">"packing"</a>
</p>
<h3> Archive descriptions </h3>
<p>
All files with a ".S??" at the end are source files for my selfwritten
6502 Assembler for the C64 (see directory "assembler"). They can be edited 
as a BASIC file and a RUN
makes them assemble, if you have my assembler in the computer's memory.

"README1ST.ASC"
        A small introduction to BDOS+
"MYCOPYING.ASC"
        My copying policy
"INSTALL ME"/"INSTALL MICH"
	These programms are the english and german versions of the 
	installation programm for BDOS+. They are quite easy to use 
	and should not need further explanation. They produce
	a small file called "AUTOLOAD", that contains all necessary
	configuration information.
"RUN ME"/"RUN MICH"
	These programms start up BDOS+
"LOADER 1.1A8"
	... is the machine programm loader for BDOS+. Basically this one
	is started by the BASIC programm "RUN ME". 
"BD+ 1.45HA"
	This is the kernel, that does most of the stuff for BDOS+. It holds
	all the Routines to handle the logical disk structure for PC disks.
	BD+ has a jump table that is being described in BDJ* that starts
	at $a000 in memory. 
"CB  1.2C9/A"
        The RAM disk and screen driver for the C64
"CD  2.0D88/A"
        The VC1571 driver for C64 with Hardware modification
"VB  1.2B9/A"
        The RAM disk and screen driver for the C128
"VD  1.5D88/A"
        The VC1571 driver for the C128
"PE  2.4A28/A", "PE  2.4B28/A", "PE  2.4C28/A"
"PR  2.4A28/A",	"PR  2.4B28/A", "PR  2.4C28/A"
        The command shells ("PE" in english, "PR" in german), with 
        Command Line Interface (CLI) and Menu Interface (MENU), with MENU
        only and with CLI only, resp.
"PRG1/A" and "PRG1.S4" (source)
        A small programm to demonstrate the use of the Directory functions
"PRG2/A" and "PRG2.S4" (source)
        A small programm to demonstrate how to pass parameters to a programm.
"S-FLOPRW 7E/A" and "S-FLOPRW.S5" (source)
        A small programm to show how to link into the jump table. It prints
        all accesses via the FLOPRW vector on the screen and waits for a
        keypress.
"S-RWABS 7F/A" and "S-RWABD.S5" (source)
        Same as S-FLOPRW, just prints all accesses via RWABS.
