----------------------------------------------------------------------------

                  This is a first introduction to "BDOS+"


What is BDOS+?

BDOS+ is a programm that lets you read and write PC Disks with 360kByte
on a stock C128 with VC1571. It also runs on a modified C64 with a VC1571.
You can format PC Disks, make subdirectories, remove them, copy files
to and from, all you need to exchange files with a PC.


Haven't I heard the name before? (How do I modify the C64?)

This is possible, as a previous version of this programm has been published
in the 6/89 issue of the german magazin "64er". "BDOS+" is a feature added
version, not a bug fixed one, as no bug has been reported (so far ;-).
In the mentioned issue you find the circuitry to make the C64 understand
the Burst transmission of the VC1571. But ATTENTION: There is an error I put
there unintendetly, the on/off switch puts +5V to your CA2, which is obviously
wrong. Instead it should switch the NOR input to +5V (off) or CA2 (on).


How does it work?

With the Burst commands of the VC1571 you can read disks in MFM format.
This format is used by PCs for their floppies and it is used for CP/M on
the C128. So the only thing to do was to write some routines to handle 
the PC filesystem ;-) This is "BD+". It is a kernel with a jump table 
at the beginning. The "devices" for Ramdisk or the VC1571 link themselves
into the appropriate jumps to handle the hardware, so that "BD+" does not
contain any hardware dependent stuff. Instead this kernel runs on both,
the C64 and the C128. For the different platforms, you have to load
different devices ("CB" and "CD" for the C64 or "VB" and "VD" for the C128).
The shells call the 'high level' kernel routines, to do their task.


How do I install/run it?

If you want the english speaking version, run the programm "INSTALL ME",
for the german one "INSTALL MICH" in the BASIC interpreter (of either
C64 or C128). These programms ask you some questions and will then
create a 'loadfile'. This file contains a list of programms to run and
the parameters to pass. After this you only have to start the 
programms "RUN ME" or "RUN MICH" (english and german, respectively) and
they start up BDOS+.


Hints...

For the first time, you should use the MENU shell. This one is quite
self-explanatory, if you keep certain things in mind:

You have the CBM drive (normally Unit 8, Drive 0) and the PC Drives 
(A: to D:). They are independent, except for the case that one PC Drive
is the CBM drive also. 

The RAM disk is always Drive C:. Before you really use it, you have to
format it, as any disk. The only thing is that you have to do it every
time (after exiting and starting again, the files are still present - 
is it a bug or a feature?).

BDOS+ does not buffer anything. That means, if you do a Copy, you have
to do it from disk to disk. If you have one drive only, you have to
use the RAM disk as a buffer. I.e. copy the files from one disk to 
Drive C: (RAM disk) and then on the other disk.

You can use a VC1541 as the CBM drive and a VC1571 as the PC drive.


Some more info?

Unfortunately all the docs I have (written some years ago) are in german. 
You should not need them for normal use. If you want to dig a bit more
into this programm (maybe a RAM Expansion Unit driver for the RAM disk?), 
feel free to contact me.


Copyrights?

See the file MYCOPYING.ASC included in this Package, or if it is not there,
feel free to contact me.
