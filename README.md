# BDOS - the bridge to your PC

This is a recovery and re-creation of the BDOS project I did in 1988/1989,
where I created a program to read and write files to PC floppy disks
on a C128 with a VC1571 disk drive.

## Folders

The folders in this repository have the following content:

- orig: the original tgz and disk archives
- origsrc: the unpacked CPK files, the un-archiver, and the unpacked source files. Note that filenames that contain slashes (/) have the slash replaced with an underscore (\_)
- recreation: source files adapted and with Makefiles that build the original binaries; "bd" is the kernel, "pr" is the prompt = menu/cli.
- src: a newly formatted version of the source files, ready for xa and continued development
